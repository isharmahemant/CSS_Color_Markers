# CSS_Color_Markers

DOCUMENTATION
.Create index.html and style.css and link style.css using the link tag.
.Give the heading to the project using the h1 tag "background-color and font-size is optional".
.Create a container using a div tag with the class "container".
.Then create another div=class "marker" to separate markers from the container so that margin and padding could work properly.
.I used the text-align CSS property to center the h1(heading) "You can select h1 only for heading or body if you have more text to center them all at once".
.Give class "container" padding.
.In the class "marker" element, create three new div's with class " marker red, marker green, marker blue" and create ".marker" CSS rule and give CSS properties ( width, height, margin & border-radius - to center the markers ).
.Then create three CSS rules ( .red, .green, .blue) and give them a background: linear-gradient, the color of your choice using ( rgb for red, hex for green, and hsl for blue)
.Back in HTML create a div with the class "cap" in all three marker classes (marker red, marker green, marker blue) and then create a div with class "sleeve" in class "cap".
.Select class "cap" and give width and margin.
.Select .sleeve and give - width, height, background color, and border-left properties.
.Now use the box-shadow property to give shadows to your markers. "you can use any CSS color values of your choice - rgb, rgba, hex with alpha or hsl, hsla.
.Create a footer and use <p> tag to give the desired text to your footer.
.In the footer, CSS rule use margin and border-radius if you use the background-color property.
